The book _Divina proportione_ written by Luca Pacioli and illustrated by Leonardo da Vinci combines math with visual arts and, on its fifth chapter, the book mentions how the golden ratio is related to the _dodecahedron_ which, in ancient science, represented the quintessence or the fifth element, also known as _aether_.

The concept of _aether_ has been used multiple times across history in theories that attempted to explain a plethora of phenomena.
